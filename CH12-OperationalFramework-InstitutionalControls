To realize the promise and prospects of big data and avoid it’s security and confidentiality perils, institutions are updating operational frameworks governing business, legal and technical dimensions of their organization and it's interactions with the outside world.  A balanced set of institutional controls are needed to achieve operational frameworks of this nature. These institutional controls must support and reflect greater user control over personal data and also large scale interoperability for data sharing between and among institutions. Core capabilities of these controls include responsive rules-based systems governance and fine grained authorizations for distributed rights management.

The New Realities of Living in a Big Data Society

Sustaining a healthy, safe and efficient society is a scientific and engineering challenge that goes back to the 1800s, when the Industrial Revolution spurred rapid urban growth and created huge social and environmental problems. The remedy then was to build centralized networks that delivered clean water and safe food, enabled commerce, removed waste, provided energy, facilitated transportation and offered access to centralized healthcare, police and educational services. 

But these century-old solutions are increasingly obsolete. We have cities jammed with traffic, world-wide outbreaks of disease that are seemingly unstoppable and political institutions that are deadlocked and unable to act. In addition, we face the challenges of global warming, uncertain energy, water, and food supplies, and a rising population that will require building one thousand new cities of a million people each in order just to stay even.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can have cities that are protected from pandemics, that are energy efficient, have secure food and water supplies, and have much better government. To reach these goals, however, we need to radically rethink our approach. Rather than static, fixed systems that are separated by function – water, food, waste, transport, education, energy, and so on – we must consider them as dynamic, data driven systems. Instead of focusing only on access and distribution, we need dynamic, networked, self-regulating systems that are driven by the needs and preferences of the citizens. 

To ensure a sustainable future society, we must use our new technologies to create a `nervous system’ that maintains the stability of government, energy, and public health systems around the globe. Currently, our digital feedback technologies are capable of creating a level of dynamic responsiveness that our larger, more complicated modern society requires. We must reinvent societies’ systems within a control framework: sensing the situation, then combining these observations with models of demand and dynamic reaction, and finally using the resulting predictions to tune the system to match the demands being made of it.  

The engine that will drive this new nervous system is big data: the newly ubiquitous digital data now available about all aspects of human life.   By analyzing patterns of human experience and idea exchange within the `digital breadcrumbs’ that we all leave behind us as we move through the world – call records, credit card transactions, and GPS location fixes, among others. These data tell the story of your life by recording what you have chosen to do. And this is very different than what you put on Facebook; your postings on Facebook are what you choose to tell people, edited according to the standards of the day. Who you actually are is more accurately determined by where you spend your time and which things you buy not just what you say that you do .   

The process of analyzing the patterns within these digital breadcrumbs is called `reality mining’, and through reality mining we can tell an enormous amount about who you are. The Human Dynamics research group at MIT have found that we can use them to tell if you are likely to get diabetes, or whether you are the sort of person who will pay back loans. And by analyzing these patterns across many people, we are discovering that we can begin to explain many things – crashes, revolutions, bubbles – that previously appeared to be random `acts of God’. For this reason the magazine Technology Review named our development of reality mining as one of the ten technologies that will change the world.

The Role of Institutional Controls

#Note Re Editor Feedback on Abstract: "It would be helpful to start with defining institutional controls are and why they are needed, and contrast them very briefly with other approaches that control data rights downstream (ie. through legal restrictions at the access stage)." Therefore including some info on what IC's are and how they relate to how institutions would implement New Deal on Data and other modernizations.

The phrase "institutional controls" refers to safeguards and protections by use of legal, policy, governance and other non-strictly technical, engineering or mechanical measures.  Currently, this approach is most commonly reflected technically as some form of ‘enterprise controls" [fn.1] related to security and legally as "regulatory compliance" [fn.2].  The use of institutional controls of this type are fundamental methods for achieving and maintaining the transition to a digital, networked and big data footing for any private company, government agency or other organization.  

Consider the analogy of institutional controls in the context of environmental law, and how these types of measures can be applied in the big data, privacy and access context to digital environments.  In the context of land, institutional controls for environmental regulatory compliance with waste management cleanup requirements could include restrictions on land use attached to a property deed, an enforceable consent order or regulations and zoning rules.[fn1]

The concept of an "institutional control boundary" is especially clarifying and powerful when applied to the networked and digital boundaries of an institution.  In the context of Florida's environmental regulation frameworks, the phrase is applied to describe the various types of combinations risk management levels related to target cleanup standards and extend beyond the area of a physical property boundary.[fn2]  


The EPA provides considerable information on the nature and use of institutional controls, including situations when the situational scope extends to adjacent properties owned by third parties.[fn3]  When institutional controls would apply to "separately owned neighboring properties" a number of issues arise.  Engagement with affected third parties, requiring the party responsible for site cleanup to use "best efforts" to attain agreement by third parties to institute the relevant institutional controls, use of third party neutrals to resolve disagreements regarding the application with institutional controls or forcing an acquisition of the neighboring land by forcing the party responsible to purchase the property of by purchase of the property directly by the EPA.[fn4]


In the context of big data, privacy and access, internal controls will take the form of governance safeguards, business practices, legal contracts, technical security and many other measures.  Specifically, the example of "living consent" described below, demonstrates how institutional controls in concert with technical methods can result in a higher level of performance while appropriately balancing legitimate interests of various parties regarding use and access to personal data...

The use of system rules and integrated participation agreements for developers and end-users is another way to track operational frameworks to institutional controls.  A governance body that approves updates or exceptions to system rules can....

The New Deal on Data

The digital breadcrumbs we leave behind provide clues about who we are and what we want. That makes these personal data immensely valuable, both for public goods and for private companies. As European Consumer Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said recently, “Personal data is the new oil of the internet and the new currency of the digital world .” This new ability to see the details of every interaction, however, can be used for good or for ill. Therefore maintaining protection of personal privacy and freedom is critical to our future success as a society.

A successful data driven society must be able to guarantee that our data will not be abused – and perhaps especially that government will not abuse the power conferred by access to such fine-grain data. To achieve the positive possibilities of a data driven society, we require what I have called the New Deal on Data – workable guarantees that the data needed for public goods are readily available while at the same time protecting the citizenry. We must develop much more powerful and sophisticated tools for privacy and reach a consensus that allows us to use personal data to both build a better society and to protect the rights of the average citizen.

A key insight that motivates the creation of a New Deal on Data is that your data are worth more when shared, because these aggregated data inform improvements in systems such as public health, transportation, and government. For instance, we have demonstrated that data about the way you behave and where you go can be used to minimize the spread of infectious disease.   Our research has reported how we were able to use these digital breadcrumbs to track the spread of influenza from person to person on an individual level. And if you can see it, you can stop it. In this instance, the result of sharing your personal data is that we can build a world where the threat of infectious pandemics is greatly diminished. 

Similarly, if you're worried about global warming, these shared, aggregated data now show us how patterns of mobility relate to productivity. In turn, this provides us with the ability to design cities that are both more productive and at the same time more energy efficient. But in order to be able to obtain these results and make a greener world, you need to be able to see the people moving around; this depends on many people being willing to contribute their data, even if only anonymously and in aggregate. 

While concrete examples such as better health systems and more energy efficient transportation systems motivate a New Deal on Data, there is an even greater public good that can be achieved by efficient and safe data sharing. To enable sharing of personal data and experiences, we also need secure technology and regulation that allow individuals to safely and conveniently share personal information with each other, with corporations, and with government. Consequently, the heart of a New Deal on Data must be to provide both regulatory standards and financial incentives that entice owners to share data while at the same time serving the interests of both individuals and society at large. We must promote greater idea flow among individuals, not just corporations or government departments.

Unfortunately, today most personal data are siloed off in private companies and therefore largely unavailable. Private organizations collect the vast majority of personal data in the form of location patterns, financial transactions, phone and internet communications, and so on. These data must not remain the exclusive domain of private companies, because then the data are less likely to contribute to the common good. Thus, these private organizations must be key players in the New Deal on Data’s framework for privacy and data control. Likewise, these data should not become the exclusive domain of the government, because this will not serve the public interest of transparency and we should be suspicious of trusting the government with such power.

Personal Data: Emergence of a New Asset Class

It has long been recognized that the first step to promoting liquidity in land and commodity markets is to guarantee ownership rights   so that people can safely buy and sell. Similarly, the first step toward creating greater idea and idea flow (`idea liquidity’) is to define ownership rights . The only politically viable course is to give individual citizens rights over data that are about them and in fact, in the European Union these rights flow directly from the constitution. We need to recognize personal data as a valuable asset of the individual that is given to companies and government in return for services .  

The simplest approach to defining what it means to “own your own data” is to draw an analogy with the English common law ownership rights of possession, use, and disposal:

• You have the right to possess data about you. Regardless of what entity collects the data, the data belong to you, and you can access your data at any time. Data collectors thus play a role akin to a bank, managing the data on behalf of their “customers.”

• You have the right to full control over the use of your data. The terms of use must be opt-in and clearly explained in plain language. If you are not happy with the way a company uses your data, you can remove the data, just as you would close your account with a bank that is not providing satisfactory service. 

• You have the right to dispose of or distribute your data. You have the option to have data about you destroyed or re¬deployed elsewhere. 

Individual rights to personal data must be balanced with the need of corporations and governments to use certain data – account activity, billing information, and so on – to run their day-to-day operations. This New Deal on Data therefore gives individuals the right to possess, control, and dispose of copies of these required operational data, along with copies of the incidental data collected about you such as location and similar context. 

Note that these ownership rights are not exactly the same as literal ownership under modern law, but the practical effect is that disputes are resolved in a different, simpler manner than would be the case for (as an example) land ownership disputes.

In 2007, one author (Pentland) first proposed the New Deal on Data to the World Economic Forum. Since then, this idea has run through various discussions and eventually helped shape the 2012 Consumer Data Bill of Rights in the United States, along with a matching declaration on Personal Data Rights in the EU. These new regulations hope to accomplish the combined trick of breaking data out of the current silos, thus enabling public goods, while at the same time giving individuals greater control over data about them. But, of course this is still a work in progress and the battle for individual control of personal data rages onward.

Enforcement

How can we enforce this New Deal? The threat of legal action alone is important, but insufficient, because if you can’t see abuses then you can’t prosecute them. Moreover, who wants more lawsuits anyway?  Enforcement can be addressed in significant ways without prosecution of public statute or regulation at all.  In many fields, companies and governments rely upon multi-party frameworks of agreed rules governing common business, legal and technical practices to create effective self-organization and enforcement.  These approaches hold promise as a method for using institutional controls  to form a reliable operational framework balancing the needs for big data, privacy and access. 

One current best practice is a system of data sharing called trust networks. Trust networks are a combination of a computer network that keeps track of user permissions for each piece of personal data, and a legal contract that specifies both what you can and can’t do with the data and what happens if there is a violation of the permissions. For example, in such a system all personal data can have attached labels specifying what the data can, and cannot, be used for. These labels are exactly matched by terms in a legal contract between all the participants stating penalties for not obeying the permission labels and giving the right to audit the use of the data. Having permissions, including the provenance of the data, allows automatic auditing of data use and allows individuals to change their permissions and withdraw data.  

A system like this has made the interbank money transfer system among the safest systems in the world, but until recently such systems were only for the `big guys’. To give individuals a similarly safe method of managing personal data, the Human Dynamics research group here at MIT, in partnership with the Institute for Data Driven Design, co-founded by John Clippinger and one author (Pentland), have helped build openPDS  (open Personal Data Store) [fn: See http://openPDS.media.mit.edu for project information and https://github.com/HumanDynamics/openPDS for the open source code].  The openPDS system is a consumer version of a personal cloud trust network and we are now testing it with a variety of industry and government partners. Soon, sharing your personal data could become as safe and secure as transferring money between banks.

Essential Elements of the New Deal of Data in the Context of Institutional Controls

To realize the promise and prospects of Big Data, and to avoid the associated privacy perils, we need a balanced set of institutional controls. Theses controls must support and reflect a greater user control over personal data, as well as large scale interoperability for data sharing between and among institutions. 

The core capabilities of theses controls should include responsive rule-based systems governance and fine grained authorizations for distributed rights management.

Our lives are embedded within institutions.  
We are citizens of countries and cities, receive services from telecom operators, and search for things to buy in online stores.  Almost any action we perform generates data, and those recordings of our lives are an important part of the Big Data promise. The data are not curated by us, but are collected `as is' - and reflect our lives.

Today, all the data people generate in the context of institutions are stored in closed silos.  Mobility traces, for example, are owned by the phone providers, while musical preferences are stored and used by music services.

For these data to be useful to society, the silos must be opened, and the data must be used far more often than they are today. If access to data for the purpose of creating value---either for the user or the society---is very limited, it does not matter how big the data is.  The value of the data lies not just in the fact that they exist.  Rather, it is the knowledge, understanding, and wisdom we gain from them that makes the data valuable.  It is an even bigger challenge to open up the data from multiple silos.  Accessing the multi-faced data, which exist under multiple jurisdictions, about people may be prohibitively difficult. Silos are hard to crack open. Such data, not just Big but Deep, covering multiple facets of a person's life, may be invaluable for research.

Recently, we have shown how challenging, but also possible, it is to open such institutional Big Data.  In the Data For Development (D4D) Challenge~\footnote{http://www.d4d.orange.com/home}, the telecom operator Orange opened access to a large dataset of call detail records (CDRs) from the Ivory Coast.  Working with the data as part of a challenge, teams of researchers came up with life-changing insights for the country.   The privacy of the people was protected not only by the technical means, such as removal of the Personally Identifiable Information (PIIs), but also by legal means, with the researchers signing an agreement they will not use the data for evil.  As we have seen in several cases, such as the Netflix Prize privacy disaster~\cite{narayanan2008robust} and other similar privacy breaches~\cite{sweeney2000simple}, true anonymization is extremely hard.  Some of the weight of privacy protection must rest on the legal framework.

Opening data from the silos by publishing static datasets is important, but it is only the first step.   We can do even more important things when the data is available in real time and can become part of a nervous system of a society.  Epidemics and traffic congestions can be monitored and prevented in real time, underpferoming students can be helped, and people with health risks can be treated before they get sick.  The same data can be used for stalking, burglarizing one's home, and as a reason to charge people more for an insurance policy.

In the Unique in the Crowd project~\cite{de2013unique}, we have shown that even though human beings are highly predictable~\cite{song2010limits}, we are also very unique.  Having access to one dataset, it is easy to uniquely fingerprint someone based on just few datapoints, and use this fingerprint to discover their true identity.   The higher the resolution of the data, the better the data, the easier it gets.

The question of privacy in this context effectively becomes a question of control:   
* Who can release the data of one's movements?  
* To whom?   
* How much and how often?  
* The data are collected by the institution.  
* The data are about people and do not belong to them, they may not even be aware that they exist.  
* People cannot decide upon them, cannot review them.  
* People cannot delete them.  
* Very few parties can use the data, even if people wanted them to.

It does not have to be like this.  
Within the existing legal frameworks, it is possible to change the vantage point of the data ownership and put the user, the entity about whom the data are, in control.  It may be a copy of the data living in the great silo, which is being given to the user.  The user would become the owner of their copy of the data, or whenever possible the original, in the old Common Law sense with the right to use, transfer, and delete the data.   An example of such a mechanism in an institutional context is Blue Button initiative~\footnote{http://www.healthit.gov/bluebutton}, where the patients can get a copy of their health records.  Once the copy is with the user, they can do with it as they wish: give it to someone, make it public, do research on it, destroy it.

The users can accumulate data about themselves from multiple sources.   Information on healthcare records, mobility patterns, favorite movies, etc., all belong to the user and can be accessed based on their authorization.  This changes how and what data that can be obtained for the purpose of research and providing services.  Rather than gaining access to the movements of millions of people from a telcom operator, one can potentially gain access to a smaller number but of much richer datasets describing the users from the mobility, health, shopping  perspectives.  New startups do not have to build the user profile from scratch, but can jump in offering competitive services based on the user's collected data.  Users can immediately get better services, using their data in new places.

The first, operational challenge of moving towards the end-user data ownership on a large scale, is to create an ecosystem where such user-owned data are noticed and accessed.  We are currently embedded in a feudal framework: Facebook owns the data generated by and about their users, and provides the access to them to the 3rd parties that user might or might have not authorized.   It is reasonably easy for users to download all their data from Facebook.   It is reasonably easy to put it on Dropbox or even create myself-API, becoming a self-hosted API to one's own personal data.   The challenge is to have clients to talk to this API and provide services, rather than going to Facebook for one's data.   Today, virtually no-one is ready to access user data directly from the user.   We have done a slightly better on the Internet scale with identity: one can deploy own OpenID server fairly easily, and many services will allow the user to sign in. We should be heading in the same direction with data.

The way the user grants authorizations to the data she owns is not a trivial matter.  Just answering the very simple question 'Who is authorized to know what city I am in today' may be a challenge.  The 'Yes' the user has clicked so many times has given access to the location data to so many services.  Every tweet, every geo-tagged picture, and every check-in provides the user's location not only to the primary service, but also to all the applications that have been authorized to access these data.  This flow of information was a crucial part of the Web2.0 revolution, with RESTful APIs, mashups, and authorizations.  The complexity of the flow became too large for a user to handle and manage.

Increasing the amount of data the user controls and increasing the granularity of the control is meaningless if this control cannot be exercised in an informed way.  The EULA-catastrophe, where the users may be just as well giving up their soul when signing up without reading, will not bring us closer to the New Deal on Data.  In the end it must the be user that makes the informed decision about who will be authorized to access the data and for what purpose.   Making the authorization interface too complex is a failure, preventing the user from understanding her decisions.   Making it too simple, is also a failure, as it will not convey the complexity of the privacy-related decisions.   Writing it in complex legal language makes it very hard to claim that the user expresses informed consent.   And if we start asking the users for authorization every 5 minutes, it will only train them to press 'Yes' every time a pop-up is presented. 

In addition to the data ownership, we need a better way for the end-user to control what happens with, now their, data.   Will users realize that clicking a single 'Yes' gives a service a second-resolution location data?   And what can be inferred from such data, regarding alcohol abuse ('we see you a lot in a liquor store'), driving habits, not enough exercise. 

This gap between the interface, the single click, and the effect, can render the data ownership meaningless.  Even the personal data need to flow in order to be useful.  Protecting the data outside of user domain is very hard.  And probably the worst that can happen is some mutation of Digital Rights Management (DRM) system for personal data.  Such system, where the data can only be used in an approved, secure context, would put the power over the data access back into hands of the big players and their walled gardens, crippling the openness of the Internet.  The cost of maintaining such DRM system, in money and in inhibition of innovation, would be too big. 

There is a need for Living Informed Consent, where the interface for the user to grant the authorizations is made to give the user understanding of the consequences, benefits and dangers of the granted authorizations.  This understanding will never be perfect, but aligning what user understands about their decisions with the reality is the goal of the Living Informed Consent concept. 

We envision several ways the Living Informed Consent can improve user's understanding of the authorizations she is granting.   The underlaying principle is that the status of the authorizations expressed via the interface (website, application) is the contract.  By pressing the buttons, the user initiates technical actions (for example creation of OAuth2 tokens), but also changes her business and legal relation with the service.  Such single screen, with a timestamped log constitutes a history of the consent.   The granularity of offered control may differ, and some actions may or may not be permitted within give institution, agreement, or service.  Still, at any point in time, the user is in certain relation with the service, in the Business, Legal, and Technical domains.   The consent only makes sense when the user understands what she is consenting to.  Why even bother asking otherwise.

Part of the gestalt is to provide concise description of the authorizations written in plain English.  The expression of those authorizations may not always be trivial and may sometime turn into paragraphs of text, yet still the goal should be to provide a description comprehensible for the target audience.  Additionally, the goal should be not only to ask for the access to data, but also include the purpose of the access.  Location is a type of data.  Using location to provide personalized music and using location to increase my insurance for careless driving are two very different authorizations.  Current authorizations frameworks do not really handle on the purpose part, focusing mainly on the data being access, no the reason for access.  This is suboptimal from the user perspective. 

Where the authorizations are granted, one possible way to make it easier for the user to understand what is happening with the data, is to reduce the dimensionality of the data already in the user-controlled domain, and only send high-level answers to the service requesting them.

A lot can be inferred from a raw location trace.  The moment the raw data leaves the user-controlled domain, it can be used for many things, some of them the user may have never thought about, and could not possibly have expressed informed consent.

Extracting the high-level features of the data on the user side, as described in the openPDS framework, should allow for more informed decisions regarding the data access.  All the raw data should not run wildly with every service providing a minuscule service to the user.

It is much easier to control what can happen and thus what are the consequences of disclosing the city you live in versus all your location updates from the last year.  It is not a perfect solution; even low-dimensionality data can still be used for evil and can be correlated with other sources.  It is however a big step in the right direction, for the user to decide upon disclosing how much liqueur she buys per week versus this information being inferred from the GPS trace provided to a service in exchange for personalized music.  When the control over the data access is given to the user together with the tools to reduce the dimensionality, it becomes less important what data are being collected, only hat is disclosed to the external services.  The user's personal data store becomes a 'master copy' of the data, containing all the possible data points.  The user then controls what answers regarding these data are shown to the world.

In addition, the information about data access and usage needs to be an integral part of Living Informed Consent.  How often do services sample user's location?  Are they tracking her in real-time, or do they access the data on a weekly basis?   Is the user singled out in how much data is queried, or is it the same for all the users?  For the user, being able to answer those questions in a simple, even casual way, is crucial for remaining in the state of Living Informed Consent.  Authorizations should not be of 'fire and forget' kind, instead they should be re-evaluated in some orderly fashion.  How often this should happen depends on multiple factors, including the sensitivity of the data accessed, reputation of the service, user preferences, the balance between control and annoyance. 

Giving the data ownership to the end-user makes it easier for the institutions to facilitate the data use.  As the users are the fully-empowered parties to make decisions about authorizing access to all their data, multiple silos do not have to be visited and contracts between them made.  It is sufficient to talk to the end-user to gain access to all the data about her.  This way, the institutions can facilities the data use becoming a matchmaking service for data access rather than data handlers, simplifying their process, while still potentially benefiting from being the 'data directory'.

A crucial component for realizing this vision is the identity of the user:  
* It must be possible for multiple institutions to find the user to give the data to.  
* It must be possible for the user to identify multiple institutions and see where the data is coming from.  
* It must be easier than remembering passwords and logging in separately to every service.  All the questions we have asked so far about the data (who owns, who controls, who decides, who accesses) must have the 'who' component addressed.

Just as the data of the user should live under single control of this user, the identity should also be brought closer to user control.  It does not necessarily mean every user should be their own identity provider, but rather than having hundreds of accounts in multiple services that do not interoperate or know about each other, the identity of the user should be build on the principle of federated identity, where the services allow the user to choose their identity provider.  In addition, just like data, certain attributes of identity need to be protected.  Service does not need to know the user's email address to be able to log the user in, a pseudonym (random but consistent string) is sufficient.  If such service has a valid reason for asking for the users address, it should be based on the users grant of authorization.  Authorization can be revoked and monitored.

In the existing system it is often hard to introduce user data ownership.  This may be due to technical reasons, such as building the infrastructure to provide the space for the data.  It may be for business or legal reasons where the data is considered not suitable for sharing.  It may be for the lack of a clear incentive as to why to do it, or how to interact with the users during the process of introduction and afterwards.  We feel the first step in introducing more privacy into such system is the notion the user must be entitled to at least know about the existence of the data about her.  The right to know about the data existence is hard to deny. It can be realized more smoothly than the transfer of the actual data.  It can be the first step towards The New Deal on Data, enforced by a legal framework.  

Using Business, Legal and Technical Scenarios to Understand and Navigate

Supporting the New Deal on Data as part of Institutional Controls involves governance, business, legal and technical aspects.  The following scenarios demonstrate signature features of the New Deal on Data in various contexts and serve as an anchor to evaluate what Institutional Controls are well aligned.  

1. Research Systems
Scenario: Computational Social Science Research Studies

Computational Social Science (CSS) studies are often based on data collected with an extremely high resolution and scale. Using computational power combined with mathematical models, such data can be used to provide insights into human nature. Much of the data collected is sensitive and private in the sense that most individuals would feel uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data publicly. The need for solutions to ensure the privacy of the individuals generating data, has grown alongside the data collection efforts. 

The data collection in the CSS context must be based on the informed consent of participants. Different countries have different bodies for regulating such studies, for example Institutional Research Boards (IRBs) in the US. Although certain minimal requirements for implementing informed consent exist, they are often not very well suited for the large-scale studies, where the amount and sensitivity of the data needs sophisticated privacy controls. As the scale of the studies grows, in terms of number of participants, bits per user, and duration, the EULA-style informed consent is no longer sufficient and makes it hard to claim that participants in fact expressed informed consent.

Just this year we have deployed a 1,000 phones study at Technical University of Denmark, where we handed out phones to freshmen students in order to study their networks and social behavior in the important change moment of their lives, when they join the university. The study, called SensibleDTU, uses not only data collected from the mobile phones (location, Bluetooth-based proximity, call and sms logs etc.) but also data collected from social networks, questionnaires filled out by participants, behavior in economic games and so on. As the data is collected in the context of the university, there is potentially a big issues of students feeling obliged to participate in the study, feeling their grades may depend on it, or that the data we collect may be used for grading. In this context, we see the implementation of Living Informed Consent not only as a technical mean to put participants in control of the data we collect, but also to convey the message about the opt-in nature of the study, the boundaries of the data usage, and parties accessing the data.

It is not feasible to explain the terms and answer all the questions to all 1,000 students personally. The controls must be self-explanatory as much as possible, and guide the user from the first opening of the link to the study to the grant of the authorizations. At the same time, every click made by the user, should be an expression of an informed decision, so the user journey must be a balance of guidance and understanding.   

As the study will last for several years, hopefully allowing us to see the life of a student from the very first friendships made until graduation party, the consent must remain alive. It is again a matter of balance: we do not want the participants to feel under constant surveillance (as they are not, the data is used mostly in aggregated form), at the same time to remember that in fact, the data is being collected about them. We are still figuring out how to achieve this equilibrium: how often should we remind the users about the collection effort? should they re-authorize applications from time to time? We see a great hope in the applications we create for the users to provide certain services, simple such as life-logging where they can see how active they are, what are their top places etc. and more advanced, such as artistic visualizations of their social networks. Making the user aware of the data being collected by transforming the data into value, can greatly benefit the privacy, making users constantly aware what is being collected, but also what kind of value they can get out of it. 

When a study of such scale is deployed, the particular experiments and sub-studies may not be exactly defined from the very beginning. The initial deployment is a creation of a testbed, where shorter or longer experiments can take place; for example part of the population may participate in the experiment of quantifying the impact of feedback application on their activity levels. Being able to create such experiments in an efficient way is a huge value for the researchers. To do that in the most frictionless way, we give the users the choice to opt-in to those additional experiments, providing some financial or other benefits. This is only possible if there is a notion of identity of the participants, stronger than a piece of paper with a signature. This participants identity allows us to reach out to people, offer them additional experiments, and let them agree or disagree to them.

This touches upon the re-usability of data, as the new experiments may require additional data to be collected, but at the same time have access to all the existing data, based on user authorization. We can imagine going even further, where entirely different studies can re-use participants data from a previous study based on their authorization. When the data are owned buy the users, they are free to authorize access to them to any party that requests it. We can see a New Deal on Data pattern here: rather than services (studies) talking about the user data, they talk directly to the users, seeking their authorization. This can address a very important problem in the research context, the data re-use in a privacy-aware manner. Rather than publishing a static dataset, where the users have lost control over their data, live and fresh data can be continuously accessed by any study that the user agrees to be a part of.

Many studies will be willing to offer money or other value for the access to the data. Other will provide the user the opportunity to have new data collected. If both those types exist, the data collection becomes exactly that, an opportunity for the user to enrich their personal dataset, and to benefit from it in the future. Join our study, we will provide you with a smartphone and collect your movement patterns for a year; we will do science and you will gain new data that can get you better services or deals in different services. You may now be eligible for a different study. Or your music recommendation may get better, because your music service can make a use of this extra data. Your data.

Future Research 

Our traditional methods of testing and improving government, organizations, and so on are of limited use in building a data driven society. Even the scientific method as we normally use it no longer works, because there are so many potential connections that our standard statistical tools generate nonsense results.

The reason is that with such rich data, you can easily uncover misleading correlations. For instance, let’s imagine we discover that people who are unusually active are more likely to get the flu. This is a real example: when we examined the minute-by-minute behavior of a small university community – a real-time flow of gigabytes per day for an entire year – we noticed that an unusual level of running around often predicted onset of the flu. But if we can only analyze the data using traditional statistical methods, we have the problem of why is it true? Is it because flu virus makes us more active in order to spread itself more quickly? Or did interacting with many more people than usual make you more likely to catch the flu? Or is it something else? From the real-time stream of data by itself you just can’t know. 


The point here is that normal analysis methods don't suffice to answer these sorts of questions, because we don’t know all the possible alternatives and so we can’t form a limited, testable number of clear hypotheses. Instead, we need to devise new ways to test the causality of connections in the real world. We can no longer rely on laboratory experiments; we need to actually do the experiments in the real world, and usually on massive, real-time streams of data.

Using massive, live data to design institutions and policies is outside of our normal way of managing things. We live in an era that builds on centuries of science and engineering, and the standard choices for improving systems, governments, organizations, and so on are fairly well understood. Therefore our scientific experiments normally need only consider a few clear alternatives (i.e., ‘plausible hypotheses’).  

But with the coming of big data, we are going to be operating very much out of our old, familiar ballpark. These data are often indirect and noisy, and so interpretation of the data requires greater care than is usual. Even more importantly, a great deal of the data is about human behavior, and the questions are ones that seek to connect physical conditions to social outcomes. Until we have a solid, well-proven and quantitative theory of social physics, we won’t be able to formulate and test hypotheses in the way we can when we design bridges or develop new drugs.

Therefore, we must move beyond the closed, laboratory-based question-and-answering process that we currently use and begin to manage our society in a new way. We have to begin to test connections in the real world far earlier and more frequently than we have ever had to do before, using the methods my research group and I have developed for the Friends and Family study or the Social Evolution study. We need to construct Living Laboratories – communities willing to try a new way of doing things or, to put it bluntly, to be guinea pigs – in order to test and prove our ideas. This is new territory and so it is important for us to constantly try out new ideas in the real world in order to see what works and what doesn’t.  

An example of such a Living Lab is the `open data city’  just launched by one author (Pentland) with the city of Trento in Italy, along with Telecom Italia, Telefonica, the research university Fondazione Bruno Kessler, the Institute for Data Driven Design, and local companies. Importantly, this Living Lab has the approval and informed consent of all its participants – they know that they are part of a gigantic experiment whose goal is to invent a better way of living. More detail on this Living Lab can be found at http://www.mobileterritoriallab.eu/

The goal of this Living Lab is to develop new ways of sharing data to promote greater civic engagement and exploration. One specific goal is to build upon and test trust-network software such as our openPDS (Personal Data Store) system . Tools such as openPDS make it safe for individuals to share personal data (e.g., health data, facts about your children) by controlling where your data go and what is done with them. 

The specific research questions we are exploring depend upon a set of “personal data services” designed to enable users to collect, store, manage, disclose, share and use data about themselves. These data can be used for the personal self-empowerment of each member, or (when aggregated) for the improvement of the community through data commons that enable social network incentives. The ability to share data safely should enable better idea flow among individuals, companies, and government, and we want to see if these tools can in fact increase productivity and creative output at the scale of an entire city.

	An example of an application enabled by the openPDS trust frame work is sharing of best practices among families with young children. How do other families spend their money? How much do they get out and socialize? Which preschools or doctors do people stay with for the longest time? Once the individual gives permission, our openPDS system allows such personal data to be collected, anonymized and shared with other young families safely and automatically. 

	The openPDS system lets the community of young families learn from each other without the work of entering data by hand or the risk of sharing through current social media. While the Trento experiment is still in its early days, the initial reaction from participating families is that these sorts of data sharing capabilities are valuable, and they feel safe sharing their data using the openPDS system.

	The Trento Living Lab will let us investigate how to deal with the sensitivities of collecting and using deeply personal data in real-world situations. In particular, the Lab will be used as a pilot for the New Deal on Data and for new ways to give users control of the use of their personal data. For example, we will explore different techniques and methodologies to protect the users’ privacy while at the same time being able to use these personal data to generate a useful data commons. We will also explore different user interfaces for privacy settings, for configuring the data collected, for the data disclosed to applications and for those shared with other users, all in the context of a trust framework.
