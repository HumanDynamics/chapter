# Ethical Issues of Data Collection, Storage and Exchange

## History and Context

* Existance of Data Systems as Emergent Happenings
Given that the new class of large data systems relevant to personal data have primarily sprung into existence based upon haphazard application of relative recent business and technical innovations, it is perhaps understandable that a clear and sufficient ethical basis for the collection, storage and exchange of data in these systems does not yet exist.


## Systems Exemplifying Ethical Precepts

* Modeling Data Systems to Include Ethics for Small and Big Data

### Potential Scenarios and Use Cases

* IAuth, 
* Algorithmic Law, 
* Data Fiduciaries, etc

### Abstracting Out the Nature and Shape of Needed Methods, Mechanisms and Modes 


##  Initial Motivation and Continuing Incentives




# Parking Lot**

**Ethical Issues:**
* Untruths or Dishonesty 
* Theft and "Conversion of Property" 
* Violence and Harm to People

**Approaches**
* The New Deal on Data (individuals own and control their personal data)
* Algorithmic Law (eg next gen municipal reg of sharing econ svcs to ensure fair, equitable results)
* Standard Law mechanisms and methods for individual authorizations mgmt and consent revocation)
* Human Oversight enabling individuals to trigger meaningful access to human decision makers (to answer complaint/question and appeals)
* Algorithmic failure conditions triggering human intervention



**Research Avenues**

##  Collection:

## Storage:

## Exchange: 

* Context 1: Point in time when individuals agree to exchange access to their personal data (ie "small data") in return for something 
* Context 2: Point in time when a organization exchanges big data with personl data (small data) of individuals mixed in with big data
