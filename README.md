This Repository is provided to facilitate collaborative drafting and coordination for writing the chapter titled: "Ethical Issues of Data Collection, Storage and Exchange" for the Springer Book: [title](http://www.example.org/)

Working Outline

# Ethical Issues of Data Collection, Storage and Exchange

## History and Context

* Existence of Data Systems as Emergent Happenings
Given that the new class of large data systems relevant to personal data have primarily sprung into existence based upon haphazard application of relative recent business and technical innovations, it is perhaps understandable that a clear and sufficient ethical basis for the collection, storage and exchange of data in these systems does not yet exist.

* Current state of affairs demonstrates need for solutions now.

## Solutions Must Cover the Entire Data Lifecycle

Covering the small and big data lifecycles;

#### Collection:

#### Storage:

#### Use:

#### Translation and Transformation: (eg from csv to json and also from web logs to sales breakdown/forcast)

#### Exchange: 

* Context 1: Point in time when individuals agree to exchange access to their personal data (ie "small data") in return for something 
* Context 2: Point in time when a organization exchanges big data with personl data (small data) of individuals mixed in with big data

## Systems Exemplifying Ethical Precepts

* Modeling Data Systems to Include Ethics for Small and Big Data

* Example: Voting - Gets aggregate results and blinds individual voter ID from otherwise transparent process
* Example: Judicial Records - Ability to seal records and redact personal info from public records
* Example: etc...

### Potential Scenarios and Use Cases

* IAuth
* Algorithmic Law
* Data Fiduciaries
* etc...

### Abstracting Out the Nature and Shape of Needed Methods, Mechanisms and Modes 

* Individual identity authentication & authorization management
* Systemic ethical metrics 
* Human oversight & review
* In Case Of Emergency... (backups, redundancy, and alternatives)

##  Initial Motivation and Continuing Incentives

Why should people (individuals, businesses, lawmakers) care about ethics?

### Incentives for building & deployment

* Thought-leading competitions (like crowdsourcing of chapters for this book)
* Grant-funded R&D projects
* Innovative startups
* Think-tanks
* Philanthropic thought leaders

### Long-term incentives

* Aligning solutions to existing mandatory law
* Aligning solutions to economic incentives
* NOT making new laws
* Novel systems built around ethical foundations
* Goodwill / altruism



# Parking Lot

**Ethical Issues:**
* Untruths or Dishonesty 
* Theft and "Conversion of Property" 
* Violence and Harm to People

**Approaches**
* The New Deal on Data (individuals own and control their personal data)
* Algorithmic Law (eg next gen municipal reg of sharing econ svcs to ensure fair, equitable results)
* Standard Law mechanisms and methods for individual authorizations mgmt and consent revocation)
* Human Oversight enabling individuals to trigger meaningful access to human decision makers (to answer complaint/question and appeals)
* Algorithmic failure conditions triggering human intervention



**Research Avenues**

## Exchange: 

* Context 1: Point in time when individuals agree to exchange access to their personal data (ie "small data") in return for something 
* Context 2: Point in time when a organization exchanges big data with personl data (small data) of individuals mixed in with big data
